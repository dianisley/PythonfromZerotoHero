# :robot: About Programming Paradigms

Programming paradigms are different ways or styles in which a given program or programming language can be organized. Each paradigm consists of certain structures, features, and opinions about how common programming problems should be tackled.

They represent the major characteristics of a programming language, dictating its behavior and refer to the pattern that a program code follows. It can be thought of as the style of programming. Common programming paradigms include:

We care about programming paradigms because there are often multiple solutions to the same problem. Often, we may even use different languages to solve a problem. Knowing about different programming paradigms can help us decide the best solution and the most suitable language for the solution to the problem at hand and increase our work efficiency.

**In the imperative paradigm,** we write statements that describe how to solve our problem step by step. A statement here refers to some action to be carried out. One thing peculiar to the imperative paradigm is that every statement changes the program’s state. A typical example of an imperative language is C.

- The procedural paradigm is a subset of the imperative programming paradigm, so it has all its features. In this paradigm, the program instructions are divided into subroutines or procedures. These are simply blocks of code to carry out specific tasks.

- The object oriented paradigm (OOP), is another form of the imperative paradigm. In OOP, everything is considered an object. Each object holds some information and methods/procedures to mutate/modify its data.

**In the declarative paradigm**, the program is written to describe what results are expected from the program without explicitly telling the computer how to carry out the task. A typical example of a language following this style is SQL. It allows us to specify what results we want, but the inner workings of the system executing it are not our concern.

# :bookmark: Introduction to Functional Programming

Functional programming is a form of declarative paradigm, it decomposes a problem into a set of functions. Ideally, functions only take inputs and produce outputs, and don’t have any internal state that affects the output produced for a given input. In this paradigm, we also have the concept of pure functions and impure functions. Pure functions are simply those that cannot modify an external variable, change the program’s state or read or write values from and to a user.
