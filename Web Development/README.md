## :bookmark: Introduction to Flask

- As a data science professional, your task is not only to create a machine learning models for an specific problem; it is also important to present your solution to the public, either a customer or your employeer adn make it available to everyone in order to have a bigger reach and impact. There is no other way then that implementing your solution in the cloud and for this you need the help of a web framework that can bring your solution to your audience with simple steps.

- Now, being Python one of the most important programming languages (as per the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2022](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#most-popular-technologies-language), it is the forth-most-popular programming language in the world with 48.07% popularity), it is a must for data scientist professionals to explore the topmost python web app framework, and Flask is one such framework that outranks the other frameworks as per the [Python Developer Survey 2021](https://lp.jetbrains.com/python-developers-survey-2021)

- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) is a web framework written in Python, used for simple and fast development of web applications and for easy configuration of backend applications with the frontend and gives developers full control over data access. It is based on the Werkzeug Toolkit (WSGI) and the Jinja templating engine ( we will explore these concepts later on) and is designed for easy REST API development.

## :gem: Why Flask

Below we will discuss the reasons why Flask is so popular among the developers and discuss what makes it better than other frameworks.

- Highly Scalable: Flask can process a high number of requests as your ideas scales up with time. The reason behind the scalable nature of Flask is its ability to modularize the codebase as it grows over a specific period.

- Easy to Use and Flexible: There are very few parts of Flask that you canâ€™t change or alter.The primary reason behind the simplicity of Flask is its documentation that becomes handy for developers in case of confusion.

- Greater Control Over Codes: Flask is one of the most recognized web app frameworks that allow developers to have complete control over the codebase. The framework enables developers to make decisions while selecting the components for development. It also provides control over the various extensions that you get with the framework.

- Support for Testing; With Flask, you get an in-built unit testing facility that enables you to test your app before making it live in production.

- Facilitates Experimentation: Flask enables you to adapt to emerging technologies and work through agile development methodologies by making continuous improvements to their products with quick integration and support systems.

- Shallow Learning Curve: Understanding the concept of Flask is not a complex task, even a fresher can learn Flask within a few weeks if he has basic knowledge of the python programming language.
