## Introduction to Flask

- As a data science professional, your task is not only to create a machine learning models for an specific problem; it is also important to present your solution to the public, either a customer or your employeer adn make it available to everyone in order to have a bigger reach and impact. There is no other way then that implementing your solution in the cloud and for this you need the help of a web framework that can bring your solution to your audience with simple steps.

- Now, being Python one of the most important programming languages (as per the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2022](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#most-popular-technologies-language), it is the forth-most-popular programming language in the world with 48.07% popularity), data scientist professonals need to explore the topmost python web app framework, and Flask is one such framework that outranks the other frameworks as per the [Python Developer Survey 2021](https://lp.jetbrains.com/python-developers-survey-2021)

Python is one of the programming languages ​​that has made a name for itself in recent years. According to the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2021, it is the third most popular programming language in the world with a popularity of 48.24%. If so, many people will want to develop web applications using Python. For this purpose, developers should explore the best Python web application framework and Flask is one such framework that outperforms other frameworks according to Python Developer Survey 2020.- Flask is a web framework written in Python, used for simple and fast development of web applications and for easy configuration of backend applications with the frontend. It gives developers full control over data access. Flask is based on the Werkzeug Toolkit (WSGI) and the Jinja templating engine. Flask is designed for easy REST API development. Flask provides various libraries, tools and modules, and many functionalities such as user request handling, routing, sessions, form validation, etc. that can be easily used to develop a blog website or a commercial website, etc.- There are many frameworks on the market for every programming language. Developers use that for their convenience and can also reduce their lead time.- Python is one of the programming languages ​​that has made a name for itself in recent years.
