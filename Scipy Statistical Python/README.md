# :bookmark: Introduction to Scipy

[SciPy](https://scipy.org/), is a fantastic library in Python (it is short for Scientific Python and is pronounced "Sigh Pi,"). This libriry simplifies the process of doing mathematical, scientific and engineering computations as it offers a variety of user-friendly and effective numerical techniques, such as routines for numerical integration and optimization. It is designed to interact with NumPy arrays. Together, they are quick to install, free, and compatible with all common operating systems. Some of the top scientists and engineers in the world depend on NumPy and SciPy because they are simple to use but have sufficient power. It is not only about less code, but is also about an efficient way to takle processes and applicatons. Scipy is a very popular library that has a wide variaty of applications, and it is extremly popular for statistical analysis.  

The scipy.stats is the SciPy sub-package. It is mainly used for probabilistic distributions and statistical operations. There is a wide range of probability functions. The statistical functionality is expanding as the library is open-source.

We have functions for both continuous and discrete variables and can work with different types of distributions like the binomial, uniform, and continuous. We can also perform the T-test and determine the T-score. Let us learn more about [SciPy Stats](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html). Below a few of the modeling that can be done with SciPy Stats

- Generate random variables from a wide choice of discrete and continuous statistical distributions – binomial, normal, beta, gamma, student’s t, etc.
- Compute frequency and summary statistics of multi-dimensional datasets
- Run popular statistical tests such as t-test, chi-square, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Mann-Whitney rank test, Wilcoxon rank-sum, etc.
- Perform correlation computations such as Pearson’s coefficient, ANOVA, Theil-Sen estimation, etc.
- Compute statistical distance measures such as Wasserstein distance and energy distance.


# :gem: Why Scipy

- SciPy contains varieties of sub packages which help to solve the most common issue related to Scientific Computation.
- Easy to use and understand as well as fast computational power.
- It can operate on an array of NumPy library
